# EasyBill
EasyBill  is  a computerized billing application for supermarkets and I developed this software during my 4th  semester of Bachelor in Computer Engineering in 2015. The traditional hand-written bill did not provide fast, reliable, and error free billing service. The task of designing and updating this application is an ever-going process. The application provides complete features to comfort users during their interaction with customers. I hope the application will entertain the users with its feature of billing system.  The attempt here is always  expected to get an error less, fast reliable bill calculating billing software which provides other facilities also along with billing and make billing in large supermarkets easier, convenient and reliable.
